# Dijkstras_Algorithm
C++ Implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm

Detailed Description to be added shortly.

IMPORTANT: Currently, the algorithm only calculates the shortest_path costs to all vertices within the Graph. The functionalities of routing table and plotting of shortest paths to specified nodes will be added soon.
